# Movie Recommender

Creates a personalized list of movie recommendations based on weighted ratings from users with similar preferences.

The project was created as a part of an educational course by Duke University.

The recommender program is integrated with the [course site](http://www.dukelearntoprogram.com/capstone/upload.php). 
This enables users to run the program interactively on the internet.

## Main features:

* displays movies for the user to rate 
  (reasonable number and variety are provided by a multistep filtering and sorting algorithm)
* creates a list of personalized recommendations (top 5 movies in every of 5 different categories)
* returns the results as a CSS styled HTML page
* handles edge cases such as empty or not enough input from the user to generate personalized recommendation
